###An Implementation of the Pomodoro Technique
---

This was an exercise to learn [React](https://facebook.github.io/react/) and [Redux](https://github.com/reactjs/redux).
It's a productivity tool that allows a user to keep track of their work habits and improve the quality
of time spent working by injecting periodic breaks throughout the day.

The theory is that while you work, you work, and only on the task you chose when you begin a *pomodoro* session.
After one of these twenty five minute sessions, you take a five minute break, and after four sessions, a thirty minute break.

The app keeps track of how many pomodoros you've completed on each task, so at the end of the day, you can gauge how long
a specific task took.

I added the ability to include any number of subtasks to any task, and I might make it so the user can check off subtasks,
as well as logging the number of pomodoros ellapsed before that subtask was checked off.

Feel free to fool around with this. If you have any questions or advice, feel free to message me!
